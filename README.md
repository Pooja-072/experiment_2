### THE MOS DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER <br>
<br>
A MOS differential pair amplifier is a building block in analog circuit design, widely used in operational amplifiers (op-amps), comparators, and sensor interfaces. It amplifies the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise.<br>
<br>
The basic MOS differential amplifier consists of:<br>
<br>
1.Two matched MOSFETs (M1, M2) – Act as the differential input stage.<br>
2.Current source (I_SS) – Provides a constant tail current.<br>
3.Load resistors (R_D1, R_D2) – Convert current variations into voltage output.
