# THE MOS DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER <br>
<br>
* A differntial pair amplifier is a circuit that amplifies the difference between two input signal while rejecting the common mode noise .<br>
* It is widely used in analog ciruits, operational amplifiers, and communivation system .<br>
<br>

## WORKING PRINCIPLE OF DIFFERENTIAL PAIR AMPLIFIER :<br>

### Basic Structure:<br>

Now assuming both the transistors are identical (m1,m2)<br>
drain resistors, Rd1 = Rd2 = Rd <br>
also Vin1= Vin2= Vincm <br>
    Vincm= Vgs + Vp <br>
The transistor to work in saturation region,<br>
    Vds >= Vov <br>
    Vds >= Vgs-Vtn <br>
    Vd-Vs >= Vg-Vs-Vtn <br>
where,
##### Vd >= Vg-Vtn<br>
from the picture you may observe ,<br>
Vg=Vincm and Vd=Vocm <br>
Therefore,
#### Vocm >= Vincm - Vtn<br>
from this we can conclude that Vincm = Vocm -Vtn <br>
Now,<br>
The total current flowing through the circuit is Iss , current flowing t
